# React: Debugging React Apps

Notes from:     
[React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)  
Instructor: Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller 

## Description

In this module, I learnt how to debug React apps, in other words,     
how to find and fix errors.

The starting project is an altered version of the previous module:     
[A Tasks List App (02-starting-project) ](https://github.com/ChristianVillalba/react_complete_guide/tree/main/02-starting-project)      
And I found and fixed the problems in the project.

## What I have learnt with this project
* Understanding Error Messages
* Debugging  
* Analyzing Code Flow and Warnings 
* Using React DevTools

# Notes:

## Understanding Error Messages

Sometimes when you're writing code, we get errors.       
Errors which the React development process catches and froze at you.

Example: Compiling Error

We will recevie a **Message** telling us what the problem is and maybe a suggestion to solve it.    
We also get a hint at the **file**,       
And the **line of code** this error is stemming from.    
We even see the **code snippet** below the message.       
Even our **IDE can detect some errors** (It won't detect all the React Errors, though).     

Some Errors are easy to fix,       
even without fully understanding the processes involved.      
Because the error message clearly tells where it is and how to solve it.      

Now other common mistakes that are often made are, for example       
typos or incorrect names.

Don't panic,       
Read error messages,         
Look at the line or the file it's coming from,          
Look at the code snippet it might be showing you,       
Look at the problematic code snippet,      
Look at the error message,      
Connect the error message to the snippet it's pointing at,      
... and you will be able to solve most errors.
