# React: Debugging React Apps

Notes from:     
[React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)  
Instructor: Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller 

## Description

In this module, I learnt how to debug React apps, in other words,     
how to find and fix errors.

The starting project is an altered version of the previous module:     
[A Tasks List App (02-starting-project) ](https://github.com/ChristianVillalba/react_complete_guide/tree/main/02-starting-project)      
And I found and fixed the problems in the project.

## What I have learnt with this project
* Understanding Error Messages
* Debugging & Analyzing React Apps
* Using React DevTools
